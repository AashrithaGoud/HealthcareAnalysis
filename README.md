# HealthcareAnalysis

I utilized Databricks to perform ETL processing, where I extracted data using AutoLoader. I then applied transformations to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) to understand the healthcare status of patients over time. The analysis focused on identifying growing diseases contributing to mortality, examining the age groups most affected, and evaluating the effectiveness of treatments, distinguishing between those that led to recovery and those that were less successful.
